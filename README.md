# neural-net

12/29/2018
Now that I've finished a basic version of the Neural Network. I'll start keeping track of what I change to see how it might affect performances.
Current Goal is to add batch learning to hopefully decrease number of epochs needed to train.
I also want to figure out why leakyReLU is performing substantually worse than the tanh activation function.
